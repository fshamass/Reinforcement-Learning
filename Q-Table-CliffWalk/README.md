# Q-Table implementation for Gym CliffWalking
#### Simple script to demonstrate the Q-Table learning with Gym CliffWalking simulation https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/toy_text/cliff_walking/
Was able to get client learn perfectly how to get over the edge (bottom line - first element is starting point and last element is target, and rest 
of elements in bottom line are fail states)
Below is also print out of the policy that agent learned from Q-Table. As shown, optimal rewards = -13 which is perfect to start from start state 
(1st element in bottom line), go up and right all way to last element and then go down to final state (last element in bottom line) and get penalized -1 
for every step.

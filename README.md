# Reinforcement Learning Modular Projects
Welcome to the Reinforcement Learning Modular Projects repository! This collection is a culmination of my efforts to gain a deep understanding and hands-on experience with Reinforcement Learning (RL). <br>The primary focus of these projects is code modularizationâ€”encapsulating related functionalities into separate, reusable modules. <br>This design philosophy ensures that the codebase requires minimal to no changes when switching between different simulation environments like OpenAI Gym or machine learning frameworks such as PyTorch and Keras.

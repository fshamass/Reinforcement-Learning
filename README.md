# Reinforcement Learning — Experiments & Notes

This repository is a personal collection of reinforcement learning (RL) experiments, prototypes and notes. The aim is to explore different RL algorithms, environment designs, and implementation approaches while keeping code modular and easy to reuse.

What you'll find here
- Small, self-contained experiments (C++ and Python) demonstrating ideas and building blocks used in RL research and projects.
- Reference implementations that are intentionally readable and educational rather than production-optimized.
- Notes and small utilities that helped me debug and understand algorithm behaviour.

Why this repo exists
- To document progress and experiments while learning RL.
- To provide bite-sized, reproducible examples you can run, inspect, and extend.

How to explore the repository
- Browse the language-specific folders (e.g. `c_cpp/`, `python/`) and open the README in the subfolder you want to run — each experiment has its own instructions.
- Use the code as a starting point: copy, tinker, and iterate.

If you want to collaborate or give feedback
- Open an issue with suggestions or questions.
- Send a PR with small, focused improvements (README, tests, build scripts).

Notes
- This project is a personal learning repository; if you want to reuse code in another project, consider adding a license file and documenting any dependencies you rely on.
